### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

âœ… I have recently stepped down from my position of Technical Lead at [FlecheTech LLC](https://github.com/FlecheTech).

âœ… I am available for short missions, part-time and full-time positions.

âœ… I would like to offer my services to companies for data infrastructure including database management and migration (SQL, NoSQL, GraphQL, REST API, etc.).

âœ… My main intests lie in AI, machine learning, blockchain, data science, and hardware development.

âœ… I am a GNU/Linux aficionado and I have experience using Docker container and Kubernetes for orchestration.

âœ… Main languages: Go, Rust, C/C++, Python, TypeScript & ECMAscript, and Solidty

âœ… Agile and DevOps methodologies preferably using CI/CD.
